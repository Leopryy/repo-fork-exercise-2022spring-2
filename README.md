# The Big Idea: What is the main idea of your project? What topics will you explore and what will you generate? What is your minimum viable product? What is a stretch goal?

For this project, the main idea would be to use the API to obtain some information and return it to the user. I also want to ask for some input from the user and store them in the database for future use. I will be exploring how to use API to get information, and how to ask for inputs from users and store them in the database for future use.The whole project is aiming to help the user to find the nearest washroom, features of the washroom, and some reviews of the washroom. 

# Learning Goals: Since this is a team project, you may want to articulate both shared and individual learning goals.

Since I am doing this project individually, the goal for myself is to explore more possibilities of API, practise writing python code with other code like mysql, and build a relatively large project properly and neatly. 

# Implementation Plan: this will probably be pretty vague initially. Perhaps at this early juncture you will have identified a library or a framework that you think will be useful for your project. If you don't have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information.

I design to have a basic website and ask for the location of the person, or get the location by the device they are using if agreed. Then, I will use the location to search the nearest washroom with the API. Moreover, not only the specific location of the washroom will be returned, but also some information about the washroom will be returned at the same time, such as the features of the washroom and other usersâ€™ comments. Further, I will also ask the user to put some comments down if they finished using the washroom. 
# Project schedule: You have 8 weeks (roughly) to finish the project. Sketch out a rough schedule for completing the project. Depending on your project, you may be able to do this in great specificity or you may only be able to give a broad outline. Additionally, longer projects come with increased uncertainty, and this schedule will likely need to be refined along the way.

In the coming week, I need to figure out which API I need to use and how to use them to realize my goal. I will write out a basic function that allows me to use the API and turn it into the form I will need to use in the future. 

After the week, I will figure out how to use mySQL and python together. This is used to store the data we collect from the users and then store it for future use.

For the week after, I will put them together to make the website, and design the layout of the web.
 
# Collaboration plan: How do you plan to collaborate with your teammates on this project? Will you split tasks up, complete them independently, and then integrate? Will you pair program the entire thing? Make sure to articulate your plan for successfully working together as a team. This might also include information about any software development methodologies you plan to use (e.g. agile development). Make sure to make clear why you are choosing this particular organizational structure.

Since I am doing the project by myself, I will just make sure I am on the right track and the project will be done nicely on time.  

# Risks: What do you view as the biggest risks to the success of this project?

The biggest challenge for me is whether I can find enough data and information for the specific restroom. If I cannot get information for the washroom, there is no output for the result.

# Additional Course Content: What are some topics that we might cover in class that you think would be especially helpful for your project?
I think that the course has provided us with the sufficient information to do the project. We have also covered the information for writing other code with python.
